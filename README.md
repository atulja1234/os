#Consider a scheduler which schedules the job by considering the arrival time of the processes where arrival time if given as 0 is discarded or displayed as error. The scheduler implements the shortest job first scheduling policy, but checks the queue of the processes after the every process terminates and time taken for checking and arranging the process according to the shortest job is 2 time unit. Compute the waiting time, turnaround time and average waiting time and turnaround time of the processes. Also compute the total time taken by the processor to compute all the jobs.



Write a program to implement priority scheduling algorithm with context switching time. Prompt to user to enter the number of processes and then enter their priority, burst time and arrival time also. Now whenever operating system preempts a process and shifts cpuâ€™s control to some another process of higher priority assume that it takes 2 seconds for context switching(dispatcher latency).Form a scenario, where we can give the processes are assigned with priority where the lower integer number is higher priority and then context switch .. as the process waits the priority of the process increase at rate of one per 2 time units of wait.
Calculate waiting time and turnaround time for each process.
